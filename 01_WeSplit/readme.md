# Project 1 for 100 Days of Hacking With Swift

### Base Project
We created a simple app that will calculate the amount each person should pay when splitting a check

### Things added
- Created addtional section header for 'Check Amount'
- Moved 'Number of People' to its own section with a header and removed text from picker
- Create an enum to allow the user to pick from a list of preselected tip amounts or use a custom
- Added a segmented picker to select '.preselected' or '.custom' tip amount
- Utilize a switch statement to condtionally display a segmented picker for preselected tip amounts or text field for custom tip
- Clamping the custom tip amount entry to avoid inappropiate values
- Add another section for 'Tip Total' that uses a computed property
